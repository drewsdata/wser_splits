        <p>This analysis aggregates available timing data for the Western States Endurance Run (<a href="https://www.wser.org/" target="_blank">WSER</a>). It is not endorsed by nor affiliated with the WSER and it relies on the work of many time keeping volunteers at WSER checkpoints. Hopefully, the information as presented here can help those fortunate enough to run the race achieve their goals.</p>
